      <h4>Previously</h4>
      <p class="right">Before GA I was a math teacher. As an educator I learned the importance of creativity in problem solving. What works in one situation often doesn’t in another. It takes flexibility and innovation to thrive. Developing personal relationships is also crucial in chasing success. Working in a room with 20 or more conflicting personalities and moods, I saw how quickly misunderstandings can devolve into conflict. Communication and patience are essential, especially in team environments, to making work run smoothly.</p>

      <h4>Now</h4>
      <p class="left">But teaching is kind of lame, so now I'm a web developer. I love solving puzzles and creating applications. I've worked on my projects and I have created three full-stack applications: Politate (a Ruby on Rails site that allows users to annotate politcal transcripts), Sugar Rush (An Express.js orering website for a proposed dessert delivery business), and Algebra! (a MEAN stack interactive educational application)</p>
